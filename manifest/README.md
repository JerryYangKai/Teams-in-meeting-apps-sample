# Manifest

Your manifest is used to publish your app configuration to Teams by manually using the "Upload a custom app" from the app gallery in Teams. 

This package can also be used to manually publish your app to the Teams store or your organization.

**NOTE: Values in the manifest.json file will need to be updated before creating the zip package to use for publishing.**
